# Indevolt integration for Home Assistant

The Indevolt integration enables direct local communication between Home Assistant and your [Indevolt](https://www.indevolt.com/) energy storage devices.

## Use cases

With this integration, you can monitor energy production and consumption as well as battery status, manage battery working modes and control real-time charging/discharging behavior, and configure power limits and other battery protection settings.

## Supported devices

The integration supports the following devices:

- BK1600/BK1600Ultra
- SolidFlex/PowerFlex2000

## Prerequisites

1. Connect your Indevolt device and Home Assistant to the same local network.
2. Ensure the Indevolt device is powered on and has acquired a network IP address. You can get the IP from the app or from your router.
3. Enable the device's API through the app.

## Installation

1. Ensure Home Assistant is running and you have administrator access
1. Open your Home Assistant configuration directory
2. Create a custom_components/indevolt folder if it does not exist yet
3. Copy the repository files into "custom_components/indevolt"
4. Restart Home Assistant
5. Add and configure the Indevolt integration if required

## Supported functionality

The Indevolt integration provides sensors for monitoring your device, as well as controls for managing battery operation.

### Configurations (Generation 2 only)

- Discharge limit: Set the minimum battery level (emergency power/SOC, %)
- Max AC output power: Configure maximum discharge power (W)
- Inverter input limit: Set maximum PV input power (W)
- Feed-in power limit: Configure grid feed-in power limit (W)
- Grid charging: Enable or disable charging from the grid (switch)

### Actions

#### Change battery working mode

Change the working mode of your Indevolt device.

```yaml
action: indevolt.change_mode
target:
  device_id: YOUR_DEVICE_ID
data:
  mode: "self_consumed_prioritized"
```

Available modes:

- `self_consumed_prioritized`: Prioritize self-consumption
- `real_time_control`: Real-time control mode
- `charge_discharge_schedule`: Schedule-based charging/discharging

#### Charge battery (real-time mode)

Configure the battery to start charging with specified power to the target SOC. The device will automatically switch to real-time control mode if needed.

```yaml
action: indevolt.charge
target:
  device_id: YOUR_DEVICE_ID
data:
  power: 1000
  target_soc: 100
```

#### Discharge battery (real-time mode)

Configure the battery to start discharging to power your home. The device will automatically switch to real-time control mode if needed.

```yaml
action: indevolt.discharge
target:
  device_id: YOUR_DEVICE_ID
data:
  power: 800
```

#### Stop battery (real-time mode)

Put the battery into standby mode. The device will automatically switch to real-time control mode if needed.

```yaml
action: indevolt.stop
target:
  device_id: YOUR_DEVICE_ID
```

## Data updates

The Indevolt integration automatically retrieves data from your devices by polling the OpenData API every 30 seconds. If an update fails, the integration will retry again at the set interval (self-recovery).

## Known limitations

- Configuration controls (numbers and switches) are only available for Generation 2 devices (SolidFlex2000/PowerFlex2000).
- Some sensors are device generation-specific and may not appear for all models.
- Some sensors / configurations available in the app are not (yet) available in the integration.
- During initialization (first minute) some sensor values might not yet shown / correct.

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot add device or obtain data

1. Ensure the device is powered on and functioning normally.
2. Confirm both the device and Home Assistant are connected to the same local network.
3. Ensure the device's IP address is correct and hasn't changed.
4. Check the device's settings in the Indevolt app to ensure that the API is enabled.

Check the Home Assistant logs for more information.

## Removing the integration

This integration follows standard integration removal.
